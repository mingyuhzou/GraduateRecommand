# 请介绍下你的爱好

One of my favorite hobbies is traveling. I enjoy exploring different cities and cultures, whether it’s a historical town or a modern metropolis(məˈtrɒpəlɪs). Traveling  helps me relax and recharge, especially after intense periods of study or work.



# 介绍下你的优缺点

**Strength:**
 I believe my greatest strength is persistence. I’m able to stay committed to a goal even when faced with setbacks or when the progress is slow. I don’t give up easily, 

**Weakness:**
 One weakness I’ve become more aware of is that I can sometimes become overconfident when I achieve quick results or perform well in a task. While confidence is important, I’ve realized that staying humble is just as critical for long-term growth. I'm working on reminding myself to keep learning from others and not let early success affect my mindset.

**优点：**
 我认为我最大的优点是坚持不懈。即使面临挫折或进展缓慢，我也会持续努力，不轻言放弃，并且能耐心地克服困难。

**缺点：**
 我意识到我有时在取得一些好成绩或者快速完成任务时，会有些过于自信。虽然自信是优点，但我也明白保持谦逊对于长期成长同样重要。我正在努力提醒自己多向他人学习，不被一时的成绩冲昏头脑。

# 介绍下你的家人

Sure. I come from a small and loving family. My mother works in furniture sales, and my father is a driver. 

They are both work very hard and have always supported me in studying well and pursuing my goals. Although their jobs are not directly related to my field, they’ve taught me the value of persistence, responsibility, and staying grounded. 

我来自一个温馨的小家庭。我妈妈从事家具销售，我爸爸是一名司机。他们非常努力，也一直支持我好好学习、追求自己的目标。

虽然他们的职业和我的专业没有直接关系，但他们教会了我坚持、责任感和脚踏实地的重要性。我非常感激他们一直以来的陪伴和支持。



# 介绍下你的家乡

I’m from Wuhu, a small and peaceful city in Anhui Province. It’s the kind of place where life moves at a slower pace. The city is quiet, with tree-lined streets, gentle rivers, and plenty of green corners to relax in. It may not be very big, but it has a calming charm that makes it a lovely place to live. I often go cycling through the parks or along the riverside when I want to clear my mind.

我来自芜湖，安徽省一个宁静的小城市。这是一个生活节奏缓慢的地方。这个城市很安静，有绿树成荫的街道，温和的河流，还有很多绿色的角落可以放松。它可能不是很大，但它有一种平静的魅力，使它成为一个可爱的居住地。当我想理清思绪时，我经常骑自行车穿过公园或沿着河边。

# 研究生规划

In the first year, I want to focus on building a solid academic foundation and reading top-tier papers to get familiar with the field and learn how to identify valuable research problems and design meaningful experiments.

In the **second year**, I hope to dive into hands-on research,and  publish high-quality paper

In the **third year**, depending on my progress and interests, I’ll decide whether to apply for a PhD or enter the job market.



# 介绍下你的专业

I'm majoring in Software Engineering. It focuses on the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. We study both theory and practice, including programming, algorithms, databases, and teamwork.

I enjoy this major because it allows me to solve real problems through technology.

我学的是软件工程，主要涉及软件系统的设计、开发与维护，既学理论也注重实践，比如编程、算法、数据库和团队合作。我喜欢它，因为它能用技术解决实际问题。



# 你空闲的时候喜欢做什么

In my free time, I like riding my bike in the park, then finding a quiet and beautiful place to just sit and think about nothing. I enjoy the peace and stillness



# 介绍一下你住的地方

I currently live in Chongqing. The weather here is quite humid—it rains a lot, and sometimes it stays cloudy for weeks.

But Chongqing has a very lively and down-to-earth atmosphere. There are lots of small streets, night markets, and great local food. It feels full of life.

我现在住在重庆，这里天气比较潮湿，经常下雨，有时候一连半个月都是阴天。

但重庆很有烟火气，街头巷尾很热闹，有很多夜市和好吃的小吃，生活气息很浓，我挺喜欢这一点。





# 介绍一下你的本科学校

I’m studying at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications. The university has strong professional advantages in information technology and computer science, and it is well recognized within the industry. The academic atmosphere here is vibrant, with plenty of opportunities for competitions, research, and hands-on projects. The campus itself is peaceful and surrounded by beautiful hills, which makes it a great place to both study and unwind.

我在重庆邮电大学学习。学校在信息技术和计算机科学方面具有较强的专业优势，在业界享有盛誉。这里的学术氛围充满活力，有很多比赛、研究和实践项目的机会。校园本身是宁静的，周围环绕着美丽的山丘，这使它成为学习和放松的好地方。



# 你觉得对于计算机专业的学生而言，最重要的能力是什么？

I think the most important skill is the ability to abstract problems. It helps us turn real-world issues into logical models that computers can solve.

I also believe information searching is very important, because we often face problems we haven’t seen before, and knowing how to quickly find reliable solutions saves a lot of time.





# 为什么选择读研

The first point is that l don't think  my undergraduate studies will make me competent for a job. The second point is that l would like to join the best school to do top-notch research and improve my own abilities.

第一点是，我认为我在本科期间的学习不能使我胜任一份工作。第二点，我想加入最好的学校，做一流的研究，提高自己的能力。



# 你如何缓解压力

When I feel stressed, I usually take a good sleep. Sleeping helps me reset my mind, and I often feel much better after I wake up.



# 本科、研究生学习的不同在于？

Undergraduates mainly learn the basics,while postgraduates focus on research and projects. 



# 你最喜欢的课程是什么？为什么？

My favorite course is English Drama Performance. It’s fun and relaxing, and I really enjoy writing my own stories and performing them with my classmates.



# 你是一个什么性格的人？

I would describe myself as a motivated and goal-oriented person. I always try to improve myself and make progress, whether in studies, projects, or personal growth.



# 你本科期间最大的成就是什么

My greatest achievement during my undergraduate years was becoming one of the top students in my major. I maintain a leading position in my grades and perform most outstandingly in various competitions, 



# 你为什么没有科研经历

To be honest, I used to think that research was something mainly for graduate students, and that as an undergraduate, my main job was to build a strong foundation.

By the time I realized that it was possible—and valuable—for undergraduates to get involved in research, it was already a bit late.



# 相比于其他同学，你的核心竞争力是什么





# 你最喜欢的书籍是什么

My favorite book is Shiji .  On one hand, I find it really interesting—the way it describes historical events is so vivid, it almost feels like being there in person.  On the other hand, it tells the stories of many different people, so I can learn from their successes and understand the reasons behind their failures.



# 你最喜欢的电影是什么

My favorite movie is Resident Evil. I find the zombie setting really interesting, and the idea of surviving in a world full of zombies is both thrilling and intense. It keeps me fully engaged the whole time.



# 本科期间学到了什么

During my undergraduate studies, I built a solid foundation by studying core courses such as operating systems, databases, and computer networks. I also enhanced my practical skills through project development and programming competitions, which improved my ability to solve real-world problems and work effectively in a team. These experiences helped me grow both technically and personally, and deepened （deepened ）my interest in further academic exploration.



# 你最喜欢的运动

My favorite sport is badminton. Unlike football, which requires a lot of running and preparation, badminton is much more relaxed — all you need is a partner and a reasonably open space. It’s simple, convenient, and a great way for me to unwind in my free time.

我最喜欢的运动是羽毛球。相比足球那样需要很多人、奔跑激烈、准备繁琐，羽毛球更轻松随意，只需要两个人和一块差不多的空地就能打起来，既方便又解压，是我课余放松的首选。



# 有人提出了反对意见你会怎么做

If someone disagrees with me, I’ll listen first, then explain my view calmly. If their point makes more sense, I’m happy to adjust. I focus on solving problems, not winning arguments.

如果有人反对我，我会先听清楚对方的观点，再表达自己的想法，理性讨论。如果对方更有道理，我也愿意接受。重点是解决问题，不是争输赢。

# 你平时是如何学习英语的

I usually build my vocabulary by memorizing words using apps or word lists. I also improve my reading and listening skills by going through English materials like short videos, or talks. When I come across unfamiliar expressions, I write them down and review them regularly.

# 你为什么学计算机

I chose computer science because it’s used everywhere these days – it’s literally changing the world and shaping the future. I want to master these skills to solve real problems and create cool stuff. Meanwhile, it also offers strong career prospects and competitive salaries, which makes it a practical and rewarding choice for the future.
